r"""
Defines representations of quantum gates (and sequences of them), and a few basic
operations for manipulating them.

A :class:`Gate` is a named tuple
``(kind: str, parameters: Tuple[float, ...], operands: Tuple[int, ...])``.

``kind`` identifies the type of unitary (e.g. ``"rx"``, ``"cz"``). ``parameters`` is a
list of float values parametrising the chosen gate (e.g. rotation angles). ``operands``
is a list of integer indices denoting the target qubits.

The convention used for the indexing of the ``operand`` parameter is left-to-right
in a bit-string. In other words, if a register is in state `|00...0>`, applying a
`π` pulse on `operand = 0` results in the state `|10...0>`. The representation of
an n-qubit state vector as a `numpy` array follows the convention 
`[c_{00...0}, c_{00...1}, ..., c_{11...0}, c_{11...1}]`. The effect of the `π` pulse
above in the 2-qubit case is to transform the array `[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]` to 
`[0.0, 0.0, -1.0j, 0.0]`

This is deliberately just a plain piece of data to make gates directly representable in
ARTIQ kernels as well (with the tuples expressed as ``TList``\ s). Even apart from that,
coming up with an extensible design for representing both values and operations isn't
trivial in the first place (cf. expression problem). This sort of weakly typed design
(with gate types represented as arbitrary strings) isn't worse than many alternatives
anyway.

Using tuples not only represents the data semantics better than lists (parameters and
operands are plain collections with value semantics), but also has the advantage of
keeping Gate hashable (so it can be used in sets/dictionaries/…).

If more complex operations (e.g. decomposition into elementary gates, optimisations,
etc.) are desired in the future, we might want to directly integrate a QC library (Cirq,
Qiskit, pyQuil, …) into our code instead, though.

A :class:`GateSequence` is a tuple of :class:`Gate`\ s that represents the coherent
portion of a circuit on one or more qubits. Tuples are used instead of lists as most of
the time, gate sequences are not changed once built up, and tuples (with their value
semantics) are hashable.

A :class:`GateGenerator` produces a :class:`GateSequence` gate by gate through an
``Iterable`` interface. Note that this will in general *not* be a list that support
indexing, but for instance an iterator. Use e.g. ``tuple(…)`` (or similar) to convert
the result to a :class:`GateSequence`.
