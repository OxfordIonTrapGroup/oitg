"""Implements circuit generation for Gate Set Tomography.

Gate Set Tomography is a method for self-consistent process tomography of a given set of
gates. It does not require any prior knowledge about the gates used to prepare and
measure in various bases, and is robust against state preparation and measurement
errors.

The protocol was developed by and around Robin Blume-Kohout at Sandia; see e.g.
[BGN+13]_ and [Blum15]_ for more details, and [KWS+14]_ and [BGN+17]_ for experimental
demonstrations.

This module only contains the (small amount of) code necessary to generate a list of
gate sequences for a GST experiment. While analysis is relatively straightforward, there
is a comprehensive and well-tested open-source implementation already available in the
form of the [pyGSTi]_ package.
